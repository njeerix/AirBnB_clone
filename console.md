Building the console
The 'Cmd' class in Python provides a framework for creating line-oriented command interpreters. It's useful for building simple command-line interfaces, often used in the test harness or administartive tools.

Key features:
* 'cmdloop()':Runs a loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input, parse the input, and dispatch to action methods.
* 'do_help()':Provides help information for available commands. It lists all available commands and theit corresponding help messages.
* Custom command handling: Commands are defined as methods starting with "do_", and special characters like "?" or "!" can trigger specific actions
* 'do_EOF()': Handles end-of-file input gracefully.
* 'emptyfile()': Allows custom behaviour when the user enters an empty line.

In summary, 'Cmd simplifies the creation of command-line interfaces by providing methods for handling user input, command execution, and help functionality.
